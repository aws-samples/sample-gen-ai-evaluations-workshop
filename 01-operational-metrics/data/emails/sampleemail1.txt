Subject: Q4 Budget Planning Meeting - Action Required

Hi Team,

Hope everyone is doing well. I wanted to reach out regarding our upcoming Q4 budget planning session scheduled for next Friday, October 27th at 2:00 PM EST in Conference Room B.

We need to review the following items:
1. Department budget allocations for Q4
2. Outstanding vendor contracts that need renewal
3. New hiring requests and associated costs
4. Technology infrastructure upgrades planned for Q4

Please come prepared with:
- Your department's current spend vs budget
- Any urgent funding requests
- Projected headcount changes

Sarah mentioned that we're currently 15% over budget in the marketing department due to the unexpected campaign costs from the product launch. We need to discuss reallocating funds or adjusting our Q4 strategy.

Also, the finance team flagged that our software licenses are up for renewal in November - we need to decide on the vendor negotiations by next week.

Please confirm your attendance by Wednesday so we can finalize the agenda.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
Finance Director
