Subject: URGENT: Project Alpha Timeline Update

Dear Stakeholders,

I'm writing to inform you of a significant delay in Project Alpha that will impact our Q4 deliverables.

SITUATION:
Due to unexpected technical challenges with the API integration, we're facing a 3-week delay. The third-party vendor (TechCorp) has identified compatibility issues with our current authentication system that require substantial rework.

IMPACT:
- Original launch date: November 15th
- Revised launch date: December 6th  
- Budget impact: Additional $45,000 for extended development
- Resource reallocation needed for the QA team

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Client communication: Marketing needs to update all external communications by Friday
2. Resource planning: HR should pause hiring for the mobile team until January
3. Budget approval: Finance needs to approve the additional $45,000 by Tuesday
4. Vendor management: Legal should review the TechCorp contract for delay penalties

I've scheduled a crisis management meeting for tomorrow at 10 AM to discuss mitigation strategies. Please prioritize attendance.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Mike Chen
