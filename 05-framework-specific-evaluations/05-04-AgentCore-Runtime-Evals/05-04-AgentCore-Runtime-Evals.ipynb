    "# 05-04: AgentCore Runtime Evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to deploy a Strands-based AI agent to **AgentCore Runtime** and evaluate its performance using the native **AgentCore Evaluations** API with built-in evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is AgentCore Runtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "**AgentCore Runtime** is an AWS managed service for deploying and running AI agents with built-in observability. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Managed Infrastructure**: Deploy agents without managing servers or containers directly\n",
    "- **Built-in Observability**: Automatic logging of agent execution traces to CloudWatch\n",
    "- **Scalable Invocation**: Invoke agents via API with session management\n",
    "- **Easy Deployment**: Use the `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` for streamlined deployment workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is AgentCore Evaluations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**AgentCore Evaluations** is an AWS service that provides the `evaluate()` API for assessing agent performance using built-in evaluators. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Built-in Evaluators**: Pre-configured evaluators like `Builtin.Helpfulness` and `Builtin.ToolSelectionAccuracy`\n",
    "- **Session Span Analysis**: Evaluate agent behavior based on execution traces from CloudWatch logs\n",
    "- **Objective Scoring**: Get numeric scores, labels, and detailed explanations for each evaluation\n",
    "- **Token Usage Tracking**: Monitor the cost of running evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use AgentCore Runtime + Evaluations?\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination provides an end-to-end workflow for deploying and assessing AI agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deploy Once, Evaluate Continuously**: Deploy your agent to a managed runtime and run evaluations against real execution traces\n",
    "2. **Production-Ready Observability**: Leverage CloudWatch integration for comprehensive logging\n",
    "3. **Standardized Evaluation**: Use AWS-provided evaluators for consistent, objective assessment\n",
    "4. **Iterative Improvement**: Use evaluation results to identify areas for agent improvement"

    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Strands Agent**: Build a city search agent using the `strands-agents` framework with web search capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deploy to AgentCore Runtime**: Use the `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` to deploy your agent to AWS managed infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Invoke the Deployed Agent**: Call your agent via the `invoke_agent_runtime` API with session management\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieve Session Spans**: Extract execution traces from CloudWatch logs for evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run AgentCore Evaluations**: Use the `evaluate()` API with built-in evaluators:\n",
    "   - `Builtin.Helpfulness` - Assess response quality and usefulness\n",
    "   - `Builtin.ToolSelectionAccuracy` - Evaluate whether the agent used appropriate tools\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Analyze Evaluation Results**: Interpret scores, labels, and explanations to understand agent performance\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Clean Up Resources**: Properly destroy deployed agents to avoid unnecessary AWS charges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AWS credentials configured with appropriate permissions for Bedrock, AgentCore, and CloudWatch\n",
    "- Access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models (Nova Micro)\n",

    "## Section 3: AgentCore Runtime Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've verified our City Search Agent works correctly, we'll deploy it to **AgentCore Runtime**. This deployment process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Agent File**: Write a Python file (`citysearch.py`) that wraps our agent with `BedrockAgentCoreApp` integration\n",
    "2. **Configure Deployment**: Use the `bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit` to set up deployment configuration\n",
    "3. **Launch to Runtime**: Deploy the containerized agent to AgentCore Runtime\n",
    "4. **Verify Deployment**: Confirm the agent is ready and test invocation via the API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Deploy to AgentCore Runtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying to AgentCore Runtime provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Managed Infrastructure**: No need to manage servers, containers, or scaling\n",
    "- **Built-in Observability**: Automatic logging of all agent interactions to CloudWatch\n",
    "- **Session Management**: Track conversations across multiple invocations\n",
    "- **Evaluation Integration**: Session spans can be used directly with AgentCore Evaluations API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The `citysearch.py` file follows the AgentCore Runtime pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bedrock_agentcore.runtime import BedrockAgentCoreApp\n",
    "\n",
    "app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.entrypoint\n",
    "def invoke(payload):\n",
    "    # Process the request and return response\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern enables AgentCore Runtime to:\n",
    "- Receive incoming requests via the `invoke` function\n",
    "- Automatically instrument the agent for observability\n",
    "- Manage the agent lifecycle in a containerized environment"

    "- **Log Ingestion Delay**: Logs are batched and sent to CloudWatch asynchronously\n",
    "- **Index Propagation**: After ingestion, logs need time to be indexed and become queryable\n",
    "- **Cross-Region Latency**: If using cross-region inference, additional latency may occur\n",

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed the AgentCore Runtime Evaluations workshop module. In this notebook, you learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✓ **Create a Strands Agent** with web search capabilities and XML output format\n",
    "2. ✓ **Deploy to AgentCore Runtime** using the starter toolkit\n",
    "3. ✓ **Invoke the deployed agent** via the `invoke_agent_runtime` API\n",
    "4. ✓ **Retrieve session spans** from CloudWatch logs\n",
    "5. ✓ **Run AgentCore Evaluations** with built-in evaluators\n",
    "6. ✓ **Analyze evaluation results** to understand agent performance\n",
    "7. ✓ **Clean up resources** to avoid unnecessary charges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AgentCore Runtime** provides managed infrastructure for deploying AI agents with built-in observability\n",
    "- **AgentCore Evaluations** offers standardized evaluation through the `evaluate()` API\n",
    "- **Built-in evaluators** like `Builtin.Helpfulness` and `Builtin.ToolSelectionAccuracy` provide objective assessment\n",
    "- **Session spans** from CloudWatch logs enable evaluation of real agent behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore additional built-in evaluators in the AgentCore Evaluations documentation\n",
    "- Create custom evaluators for domain-specific assessment\n",
    "- Integrate evaluations into your CI/CD pipeline for continuous agent quality monitoring\n",
    "- Review the other workshop modules for more evaluation techniques"
